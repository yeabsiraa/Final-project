   <p>This is also the area where musical and artistic traditions have influenced the culture of our country. The countries of West Africa include: Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo.West Africa has a rich natural resource base that includes soil, forest, rangeland, and freshwater and marine resources. Increased pressure on these resources from the rapidly growing population is compounded by the region's vulnerability to climate shocks such as recurrent drought and rising sea levels.</p>

   <p> <strong>History:</strong>
     Axes belonging to a Neolithic culture have been found in the north of Burkina Faso. The Bobo, the Lobi, and the Gurunsi are the earliest known inhabitants of the country. About the 15th century CE, conquering horsemen invaded the region from the south and founded the Gurma and Mossi kingdoms, in the eastern and central areas, respectively. Several Mossi kingdoms developed, the most powerful of which was that of Ouagadougou, located in the centre of the country. Headed by an emperor, the morho naba (“great lord”), the Ouagadougou Mossi state defeated attempted invasions by the Songhai and Fulani empires yet maintained valuable commercial links with major western African trading powers, including the Dyula, the Hausa, and the Asante.</p>

   <p><strong>History:</strong>
     In the 15th century, Ivory Coast was part of the West African trade route in which Europeans purchased gold, ivory, pepper and slaves. French, Portuguese, and British traders established outposts in the region.In 1893, Ivory Coast officially became a French colony. The African population, led by Samori Ture, strongly resisted French colonization and settlement until 1898 when Ture was captured. France’s colonial policy in West Africa reflected concepts of association, such that all Africans were French “subjects’ without representation in either Africa or France, and assimilation, which entailed extension of the French language, institutions, laws and customs in the territory.After World War II, and in response to African allegiance during the war, France provided French citizenship for all African ‘subjects’ and the right to politically organize. In 1960, Ivory Coast gained independence as a result of a referendum by the French government to grant community status to all former French West African colonies.The country’s first president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, brought ethnic harmony and economic development to Ivory Coast. When Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993, he favored Henri Bedie as his successor.Unlike Houphouet-Boigny, Bedie emphasized nationalism, and excluded his rival Alassane Ouattara from running for president because of his alleged Burkina Faso parentage. Bedie also jailed opposition supporters and excluded opponents from the army, which resulted in a military coup in 1999 led by Robert Guei.In 2000 Laurent Gbagbo was elected as president to replace Guei. Outtara continued to be disqualified from elections, which sparked violent protests from Muslims in the north who felt they were being discriminated against in Ivorian politics.In 2002, rebel forces from the north launched attacks in several cities. French troops pushed back against the rebels, and President Gbagbo responded by attacking residents in shanty towns in the north.In January 2003, Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed an agreement creating a unified government. The government was unstable, though, and violence continued. Presidential elections were due in 2005, but Gbagbo postponed them until 2010 </p>

       When Portuguese mariners discovered Cape Verde in 1456, the islands were uninhabited but fertile enough to attract the first group of settlers six years later. They founded Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha), the first European town in the tropics, on the island São Vicente.</p>
     <p><strong>Land:</strong>
     The Cape Verde Islands are located in the mid-Atlantic Ocean some 570 km (354 mi) off the west coast of the continent of Africa. The landscape varies from dry plains to high active volcanoes with cliffs rising steeply from the ocean. The climate is arid.</p>

     Cape Verde, officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island country comprised of an archipelago of ten volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, about 350 miles off the coast of Western Africa.

In 2019, the population of Cape Verde is estimated at 549,935, down from 514,000 in 2014, which makes it the 172nd most populous country in the world</p>

      <p><strong>Histroy:</strong>
        The kingdom of Benin began in the 900s when the Edo people settled in the rainforests of West Africa. By the 1400s they had created a wealthy kingdom with a powerful ruler, known as the Oba. The Obas lived in beautiful palaces decorated with shining brass. Gradually, the Obas won more land and built up an empire. They also started trading with merchants from Europe. For 200 years Benin was very successful, but in the 1600s the Obas started to lose control of their people. By the 1800s Benin was no longer strong or united. The kingdom came to a sudden end in 1897, when a British army invaded and made it part of the British Empire
