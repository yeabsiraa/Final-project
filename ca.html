    <h2>ANGOLA</h2>
    <p>The modern nation state of Angola came into existence after the Portuguese Empire colonised the various local people and created the colony of Angola.
      The colonial conquest of Angola by the Portuguese was a process which unfolded in various stages over almost 400 years.</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong> Until the late 19th century, parts of Angola were covered with dense rainforest, mainly in the northern
      part of the Cabinda exclave, the western edge of the Malanje highlands, the northwestern corner of the Bié Plateau, and along some rivers in the northeast.</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong> The mixture of Portuguese and African culture has made urban Angola, especially the Luanda region, more like a Latin American than an African country.
      Its nightclubs, restaurants, and annual Carnival might seem at home in Brazil had not war and security measures made this sort of social life difficult.
      Nevertheless, the country has much to celebrate in its cuisine, festivals, and artistic traditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong> Coastal people include much seafood in their diet, herders in the southwest rely mostly on dairy products and meat, and farmers eat maize, sorghum, cassava and other agricultural crops.
      Especially in urban areas but also in the drier rural areas, gathering water and firewood is often time-consuming.
      Salt is a highly prized product in many areas.</p>
    <br>


    <h2>CAMEROON</h2>
    <p>A country lying at the junction of western and central Africa.
      Its ethnically diverse population is among the most urban in western Africa.
      The capital is Yaoundé, located in the south-central part of the country.</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>Cameroon is triangular in shape and is bordered by Nigeria
      to the northwest, Chad to the northeast, the Central African Republic to the east,
      the Republic of the Congo to the southeast, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea to the south,
      and the Atlantic Ocean to the southwest.</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong> Each major ethnic group of the country has developed its own culture. from the drums by the people of the southern forest region contrast
      with the flute music of northern Cameroonians, to the Ngoutou people for two-faced masks, and the Bamum for smiling masks</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>In general, the Cameroonian diet is characterized by bland, starchy foods that are eaten with spicy (often very hot) sauces.
      Meat on skewers, fried and roasted fish, curries and peppery soups are common dishes.
      Staple foods eaten in the north are corn, millet, and peanuts</p>
    <br>

    <h2>CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC</h2>
    <p>A landlocked country located in the centre of Africa.
      The area that is now the Central African Republic has been settled for at least 8,000 years.
      The earliest inhabitants were the probable ancestors of today’s Aka (Pygmy) peoples, who live
      in the western and southern forested regions of the country. </p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>The country lies largely in the savanna zone of Africa.
      The northern part is treeless, whereas the southern portion of the country contains
        dense tropical rainforests, particularly along the Ubangi and Sangha rivers.</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>In most Central African families, women continue to play a crucial role in
      the gathering, production, conservation, distribution, and preparation of food.
      Hunting, trapping, and fishing—male occupations—remain important for the subsistence
      of many Central Africans, and women in some regions fish during the dry season.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>Many dishes contain gombo (okra), tomato and onion, although other popular
      ingredients include rice, bananas and cassava. The most commonly eaten meats are chicken and goat,
      with bushmeat hunted in more rural areas.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>CHAD</h2>
    <p>Most of the population lives by agriculture; cotton is grown in the south, and cattle are raised in the central region.
      Chad joined the ranks of oil-producing countries in 2003, raising hopes that the revenues generated would improve the
      country’s economic situation</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>Most of the population lives by agriculture; cotton is grown in the south
      and cattle are raised in the central region.</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>With its rich variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a valuable cultural heritage.
      The country is famed for the rock paintings of its ancient inhabitants,
      which can be found in abundance in the caves and rock overhangs of the Tibesti Mountains.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>Chad is made up of over 140 different ethnic groups, whose diets are as diverse as their cultural traditions.
      The Arabs of northern Chad--who are nomadic or live in the capital of N'Djamena--eat staples of dairy and meat, while groups in the
      agricultural south have a plant-based diet. However, there are certain national dishes that all Chadians share.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</h2>
    <p>The country that began as a king’s private domain (the Congo Free State), evolved into a colony (the Belgian Congo),
      became independent in 1960 (as the Republic of the Congo), and later underwent several name changes (to the Democratic
      Republic of the Congo, then to Zaire, and back again to the Democratic Republic of the Congo). </p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>Animal life is also rich and diverse.
      Chimpanzees are found mostly in the equatorial forest, and gorillas live in the eastern mountains around Lake Kivu.
      Bonobos are also present, though they are found only in lowland rainforests along the south bank of the Congo River.</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>The cities, especially Kinshasa, are the greatest creators, propagators, and promoters of national cultural life and arts.
      The Academy of Fine Arts in Kinshasa offers training programs in painting, sculpture, carving, architecture, and ceramics.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>The food in this country reflects their culture in many ways.
      Perhaps the most obvious reason is that they mainly eat cheap foods. This country’s citizens
      are not known for being very wealthy, so they make the most out of what they can afford.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>EQUATORIAL GUINEA</h2>
    <p>Bata is the administrative capital of the mainland.
      Formerly a colony of Spain with the name Spanish Guinea,
      the country achieved its independence on October 12, 1968.
      The capital is Malabo, on Bioko.</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>The main island, Bioko, is about 45 miles (72 km) long and 22 miles (35 km) wide.
      Its extinct volcanic cones, crater lakes, and rich lava soils form a contrast with the landscape of the mainland.
      In the north Santa Isabel Peak (Basile Peak), an extinct volcano, soars to a height of 9,869 feet (3,008 metres).</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>Despite a veneer of Spanish culture and of Roman Catholic religion that is thicker in Bioko than on the mainland,
      many Equatorial Guineans live according to ancient customs, which have undergone a revival since independence.
      Among the Fang of the mainland, witchcraft, traditional music (in which the Fang harp, the xylophone, the great
      drums, and the wooden trumpet are used), and storytelling survive. Among the Bubi farmers of Bioko, some ancient
      customs are still followed as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>Most Equatorial Guinean cuisine is derived from its native tribes people, including pygmies and
      various West African ethnic tribes originating from the Bantus.
      The indigenous people of Equatorial Guinea use mostly plant-based ingredients, such as cassava, plantains and yams in their cooking.
      Early settlers and merchants from Portugal, Spain and the Middle East also influenced the tiny country’s cuisine.
      Today, the majority of restaurants throughout the country serve Spanish or European fare, such as tapas or marinated meat dishes.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>GABON</h2>
    <p>Gabon favoured close relations with France and the continued use of French language and culture.
      It opposed political ties with the other states of sub-Saharan Africa, however,
      because of dissatisfaction with the previous federation and a desire to develop its natural resources for its own benefit</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>About three-fourths of the country is covered by a dense equatorial rainforest containing more than 3,000
      species of vegetation, including the okoumé, a hardwood tree that forms the backbone of Gabon’s timber industry.
      The rainforest is inhabited by antelope, monkeys, gorillas, numerous tropical birds, and several varieties of elephants.
      Gabon has several national parks, including Lopé National Park (originally Lopé-Okanda Wildlife Reserve, founded in 1946) in the centre of the country.
      The park and related archaeological sites—referred to as the Ecosystem and Relict Cultural Landscape of Lopé-Okanda—were collectively designated a
      UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>The French influence on Gabonese culture is prevalent. At the same time,
      there has been continued interest in Gabon’s precolonial history and traditions, and much research continues on the Fang epic
      (mvet) and the art of the Mpongwe, Fang, and Kota. In 1983 the International Centre for Bantu Civilizations was created, with its headquarters at Libreville.
      The National Museum of Arts and Traditions is also in Libreville.</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>Good dining options abound in Gabon’s cities, especially in the capital town of Libreville. Eating out is enjoyable, as many interesting
      establishments serve a variety of cuisines, but prepare to pay more than in neighboring countries.
      Traditional plates come with yams or cassava, rice, or manioc paste, paired with either meat or fish. Spicy sauces are also commonplace, as is cassava-flour (gari) porridge.
      French cooking is popular in the cities, as are local favorites like nyembwe, chicken seasoned with pine nuts, meat, fufu stews, and stuffed crab.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</h2>
    <p>The Republic of Congo, also known as Middle Congo, Congo-Brazzaville, and Congo (but not to be confused with the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
      formerly Zaire, which was also at one time known as the Republic of the Congo), is a former French colony of west-central Africa.
      It shares common borders with Gabon, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo
      and the Gulf of Guinea. Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo.
      The Republic of Congo is one of Africa’s oil rich states, however its economic potential is hampered by the current ongoing civil war.</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>About two-thirds of the country is covered with coarse-grained soils that contain sand and gravel.
      Because of the hot and humid climate, organic matter is decomposed by rapid bacterial action before it can accumulate into humus; moreover,
      topsoil is washed away by the heavy rains.
      In the savanna regions, the fertile alluvial soils are threatened with erosion by wind as well as rain. A diverse pattern of coarse- and fine-grained
      soils covers the plateaus and hills</p>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>Precolonial artistic expression emphasized ceremonial music, dance, sculpture, and oral literature.
      Christianity and colonialism had a great impact on these art forms. The carving of ritual objects became commercialized, and
      music and dance altered as a result of the introduction of Western instruments and musical styles. In the 1980s the Brazzaville region,
      along with Kinshasa, across the river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, became a vital centre for the production of contemporary
      African music, known as Congolese music or rumba</p>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>The rain forest soil is not nutrient-rich; less than 3 percent of the land is cultivated for food production.
      Meat is expensive because it has to be hunted or imported. For this reason, little meat is eaten. Bananas, pineapples, taro, peanuts,
      manioc, cassava, rice, and bread are the staples.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE</h2>
    <p>The country’s first president, Manuel Pinto da Costa of the MLSTP, was elected in 1975.
      The government initially followed eastern European models of political and economic organization.
      Economic decline and popular dissatisfaction, however, led to a process of liberalization that started
      in 1985 and culminated in the establishment of a multiparty democracy in 1990.</p>
    <p><strong>Land:</strong>The flora and fauna include many rare and endemic species, reflecting the isolation and
      environmental diversity of the islands. Birds such as the ibis, shrike, and grosbeak can be found in Sao Tome and Principe.
      Many of the plants, birds, reptiles, and small mammals are threatened by pressure on the remaining rainforest.</P>
    <p><strong>Life:</strong>This small country has a homogeneous creole culture, profoundly marked by centuries of blending elements of the dominant
      Roman Catholic Portuguese culture with various African influences. The kinship system is bilateral, although men traditionally have been polygynous.
      With the virtual absence of monogamous marriage, the conjugal system is characterized by a high incidence of multiple and serial customary unions and
      visiting relationships; as a result, about one-third of households are headed by females.</P>
    <p><strong>Food:</strong>The traditional cuisine of São Tomé and Príncipe is of Cape Verdean and Portuguese persuasion.
      The local cuisine heavily makes use of fried fish usually partnered with their breadfruit known as fruta pão or plaintain,
      coupled with local produce such as the tropical fruits banana, pineapple and avocado. Fish is their main source of protein,
      which is mostly eaten with indigenous root crops. Their snack consists of corn, and part of their food culture is eating monkey meat and fruit bats.
      Most houses have citrus trees planted on their yards.</p>
