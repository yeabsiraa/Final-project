  <p><strong>South Africa</strong><br>
    South Africa is a 104 years old.
    In the early 21st century the economy of South Africa grew but recently it has slowed.
    South Africa suffers from high unemployment. The country also suffers from widespread poverty.
    However, tourism in South Africa is an important industry. South Africa is also rich in minerals.
    Today the population of South Africa is 56 million.</p>
  <p><strong>Land:</strong>Most of South Africa's landscape is made up of high, flat areas called plateaus.
    These lands are covered with rolling grasslands, called highveld, and tree-dotted plains called bushveld.</p>
  <p><strong>Life:</strong>As they are everywhere in the world, patterns of daily life in South Africa are conditioned by social class, ethnicity, religion, and residence:
    the life of a black diamond miner in Limpopo province is much different from that of an Indian shopkeeper in Durban, an Afrikaner office worker in Johannesburg, or a teacher of English extraction in Cape Town.
    As the government struggles to expand the economy in order to provide equally for all citizens, great disparities continue to exist.
    Yet, all these people are likely to enjoy much the same pleasures:
    the company of family and friends, films from the studios of Johannesburg and Hollywood alike, music and dance, and
    visits to South Africa’s magnificent national parks and scenic landscapes</p>
  <p><strong>Food:</strong>All South Africans enjoy the braai, a South African barbeque.
    Beef, chicken, lamb, pork, ostrich, and other game meat are savoured, although meat consumption is
    limited in many places because of its expense</p>

  <p><strong>Botswana</strong><br>Since gaining independence Botswana’s history has not not been without turmoil,
    but the country has emerged as a model African state. Botswana is home to the world's largest diamond mine and its leaders are wary of over-dependence on a single industry.
    Their economic growth has raised them into the middle-income bracket, although there is still high unemployment and socioeconomic stratification.</p>
  <p><strong>Land:</strong>The country is divided into three main environmental regions.
    The hardveld region consists of rocky hill ranges and areas of shallow sand cover in eastern Botswana.
    The sandveld region is the area of deep Kalahari sand covering the rest of the country.
    The third region consists of ancient lake beds superimposed on the northern sandveld in the lowest part of the Kalahari Basin.</p>
  <p><strong>Life:</strong>The cultural life of Botswana reflects the dual heritage and intermingling of Tswana and English cultural domination.
    The two languages and cultures are subtly mixed and alternated in urban and official situations.
    Western dress has been general among people in Botswana, except at the poorest level, since the late 19th century.
    Rites of burial, marriage, and birth have been adapted to Christianity and remain extremely important in Botswana life.
    Football (soccer) is the national sport, played on fields and in stadiums across the country every Saturday.</p>
  <p><strong>Food:</strong>Common diet and cuisine consist of sorghum and corn (maize) porridge, beans and other pulses, and traditional spinach, supplemented by tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and cabbage usually purchased from stores.
    Meat consumption has become more common with the opening of small butcheries selling beef.
    Traditional foods include dried phane caterpillars from mopane woodland, eaten as relish or snacks,
    fruits such as the wild morula plum, and beer made from sorghum or millet</p>

<div class="info">
  <p><strong>Lesotho</strong><br>The territory now known as Lesotho was occupied as early as the Neolithic Period (New Stone Age) by Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers.
    From about the 16th century, African farmers—the ancestors of the present population—moved across the grasslands of Southern Africa and settled in the fertile valleys of the Caledon River, where they came to dominate the hunters of the region.
    These stock-keeping agriculturalists belonged to the large Sotho group and were divided into numerous clans that formed the nucleus of chiefdoms, whose members occupied villages.</p>
  <p><strong>Land:</strong>The country forms an enclave within South Africa, bordering on three of the latter’s provinces—KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, and Eastern Cape.
    Like only two other independent states in the world (Vatican City and the Republic of San Marino), Lesotho is completely encircled by another country, on which it must depend for access to the outside world.</p>
  <p><strong>Life:</strong><br>
    <strong>Urban life</strong> is a blend of traditional and Western culture.
    In Maseru there are shops and markets that offer regional crafts and goods, as well as modern and Western hotels, restaurants, and nightclubs.
    Many buildings, however, were burned or damaged by looting following the general election of 1998.
    The city also contains urban villages where tourists can experience traditional life in Lesotho.<br>
    <strong>Village life</strong>Village life centres largely on the fields, the chief’s court, the kraals, the school, the church, and the initiation lodge.
    Circumcision forms an integral part of the ritualized initiation ceremonies that train boys to take their place as full members of the family, clan, and nation—the three centres of social cohesion.
    Many young boys spend a large part of their lives as herdsmen, while women and young girls do much of the hard work in the fields. Because of the sharp variations in climate, both men and women wear blankets, often multicoloured, which they use as cloaks.
    Men and women also wear the typical Sotho hat, which is woven from reeds into conical shapes and has a decorative topknot.</p>
  <p><strong>Food:</strong>Originally named Basutoland, the Kingdom of Lesotho in Southern Africa is a mountainous territory, home to primarily indigenous Basotho. However, the culture is a blend of numerous tribes and traditions that have melded into the current ethnic culture that exists today.
    The country's food is simple, and since many food resources need to be imported, most families raise food and livestock to support themselves throughout the year.</p>

  <p><strong>Namibia</strong><br> Today Namibia is still a poor country but its economy is growing steadily.
    Namibia depends heavily on the export of minerals.
    Today the population of Namibia is 2.4 million. </p>
  <p><strong>Land:</strong> Namibia, a country in southwest Africa, is distinguished by the Namib Desert along its Atlantic Ocean coast.
    The country is home to diverse wildlife, including a significant cheetah population.</p>
  <p><strong>Life:</strong> On the whole, Namibians are a conservative and God-fearing people – an estimated 80% to 90% of the country is Christian – so modesty in dress and behaviour is considered important.
    Education is a crucial pillar to advancement in the country, but Namibians (especially women) still struggle to enjoy the benefits of an economy that is, for the most part, performing well.</p>
  <p><strong>Food:</strong> Food in Namibia, for the black population at least, has always been more about survival than inspiration, although you're unlikely to encounter the basic food eaten by most Namibians on most tourist menus.
    Instead, you'll find predominantly international dishes on most menus, with a couple of local variations – German dishes (particularly cakes and pastries) are a highlight, as are the widely available game meats (eg eland, oryx or kudu).</p>

  <p><strong>Eswantini (formerly known as Swaziland)</strong><br> Bantu peoples migrated southwest to the area of Mozambique in the 16th century.
    A number of clans broke away from the main body in the 18th century and settled in Eswatini. In the 19th century these clans organized as a tribe, partly because they were in constant conflict with the Zulu.
    Their ruler, Mswazi, appealed to the British in the 1840s for help against the Zulu. The British and the Transvaal governments guaranteed the independence of Eswatini in 1881</p>
  <p><strong>Land:</strong> Eswatini is one of the best-watered countries in southern Africa.
    Major perennial rivers, which have their sources in South Africa, flow through the country to the Indian Ocean.
    They are the Lomati, the Komati, the Umbuluzi, and the Usutu. The Usutu has the largest catchment in the country, with three main tributaries, the Usushwana, the Ngwempisi, and the Mkhondvo.
    In the south the Ingwavuma rises in western Eswatini and also cuts through the Lubombo.</p>
  <p><strong>Life:</strong> Despite the changes wrought by the money economy, by a high degree of literacy and basic education,
    and by steadily improving living standards and changing life-styles, tradition continues to play an important role in Swazi society,
    both at the national ceremonial level and in day-to-day personal contacts. This reflects the unity of the Swazi as one nation under a traditional
    leader and especially their reverence for the struggle of King Sobhuza II over the 61 years of his reign to regain their independence</p>
  <p><strong>Food:</strong> The traditional food supply fluctuated seasonally.
    Between winter and the new crops of summer, shortages were common.
    Maize and millet were the main staples. Dairy products, especially soured milk, were reserved for children.
    Cattle were slaughtered mainly for ritual purposes, and meat was in short supply. Leafy vegetables, roots, and fruits completed the traditional diet.
    The introduction of supermarkets means that meat and other products are available throughout the year.
    The Swazi typically observed a fish taboo, along with a taboo on egg consumption for females and a dairy taboo for wives.
    There were also clan-specific food taboos on particular birds and wild animals</p>
